        From death we spring, from life we come about.
        <br />
        A form we used to love and hate throughout.
        <br />
        Tis solace we find in things light and might.
        <br />
        A time of change, a time of fear and strife.
        <br />
        Memoir of members frozen tight in ice.
        <br />
        Thoughts of present, past, and future tried.
        <br />
        So now comes time, reveal this hidden glee.
        <br />
        How short, how sweet, recall what used to be.
